                        skills, poor grammar, not so good looking face, personal hygiene among other minor issues hehe. But that doesnt change the fact that youve been my crush for a long time and i will one day tell you that. If only you hadn't blocked
                        me from facebook, twitter , instagram and whatsapp it would have been sooner rather than later
